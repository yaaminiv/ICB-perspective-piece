This, in turn, affects the stability of ecological systems and the security of the aquaculture industry. In this study, we investigated the effects of different fasting regimens (GY: fasting at 1-day intervals, GL: fasting at 2-day intervals) on the behavioral and physiological adaptability of Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai), a marine gastropod, particularly in response to recurrent marine heat waves. Our findings revealed that the survival rates of abalone in both the GY and GL groups were significantly higher than those in the unfasted control group (ZC) (P < 0.05). Furthermore, behavioral assessments revealed that the cumulative distance moved, feeding durations, and the percentage of cumulative feeding time relative to movement time were significantly greater in the GL group compared to both the ZC and GY groups (P < 0.05). Sequencing of the 16S rDNA amplicon revealed that the intestinal microbial community of abalone in the GL group harbored a higher abundance of beneficial bacteria (Arenimonas, Pseudolabrys) compared to the GY and ZC groups. In contrast, the potentially harmful bacterium Tenacibaculum was significantly reduced in the GY group relative to the ZC group (P < 0.05). A non-targeted metabolomics analysis identified amino acids and fatty acids, such as Citrulline, Leu-Pro, and L-Glutamate, as differential metabolic markers. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the 'Biosynthesis of amino acids' pathway was significantly enriched in both the GY and GL groups compared to the ZC group (P < 0.05). Further analysis of 23 amino acids showed that 15 and 20 amino acids, including glycine and serine, were downregulated in the GY and GL groups, respectively, compared to the ZC group. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the relative abundance of both Arenimonas and Pseudolabrys in the abalone's gut and citrulline content in the GY and GL groups (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that intermittent fasting not only promotes energy redistribution, serving as an effective strategy for abalone to cope with oceanic heat waves, but also provides valuable insights into the behavioral and physiological plasticity of marine shellfish in response to global climate change.",10.1016/j.aquaculture.2025.742367,Web of Science

While some studies have shown the effect of marine heatwaves in warm temperate climates and the effect of overall higher temperature in warm and cold temperate climates, it is yet not entirely understood how heatwaves impact marine urban communities in cold temperate climates. As thermal resistance might be related to selective pressures and acclimation, it seems reasonable to assume that they may have a strong impact on local fauna and flora. In the present study, we simulated an in situ high amplitude heatwave and observed the community structure and the metabolism of Bugula neritina at two time-steps after the heatwave and compared them to control communities and individuals. Contrary to our expectations, the community structure remained vastly unaffected, as did the total metabolome of B. neritina. This shows that the community was able to resist the disturbance of the heatwave. Bugula neritina additionally showed a certain metabolic resilience as the already minor differences in the metabolome between control and the heatwave treatment diminished even further between the tested time steps.",10.1016/j.marenvres.2024.106813,Manual

In this study, common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis embryos and juveniles, were exposed to five pH conditions (pHT 8.08 to 7.43). Growth, development and metabolite profiles were explored during the embryonic development period up to 10 days-post-hatching. Our results show delayed embryonic development and decreased hatching success at pH 7.43, but no effect on juvenile weight upon hatching. The 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed that decreasing pH affected metabolites profiles in embryos until a metabolic suppression was observed at pH 7.43. The O2 consumption in 10d-old juveniles did not change with pH whereas metabolites indicated a switch to anaerobic metabolism under low pH.

The effects of thermal stress on metabolic exchange (i.e., transfer of fixed carbon photosynthates from symbiont to host) during sensitive early life stages, however, remains understudied. We exposed symbiotic Montipora capitata coral larvae in Hawaiʻi to high temperature (+2.5°C for 3 days), assessed rates of photosynthesis and respiration, and used stable isotope tracing (4 mM 13C sodium bicarbonate; 4.5 h) to quantify metabolite exchange. While larvae did not show any signs of bleaching and did not experience declines in survival and settlement, metabolic depression was significant under high temperature, indicated by a 19% reduction in respiration rates, but with no change in photosynthesis. Larvae exposed to high temperature showed evidence for maintained translocation of a major photosynthate, glucose, from the symbiont, but there was reduced metabolism of glucose through central carbon metabolism (i.e., glycolysis). The larval host invested in nitrogen cycling by increasing ammonium assimilation, urea metabolism, and sequestration of nitrogen into dipeptides, a mechanism that may support the maintenance of glucose translocation under thermal stress. Host nitrogen assimilation via dipeptide synthesis appears to be used for nitrogen limitation to the Symbiodiniaceae, and we hypothesize that nitrogen limitation contributes to retention of fixed carbon by favoring photosynthate translocation to the host. Collectively, our findings indicate that although these larvae are susceptible to metabolic stress under high temperature, diverting energy to nitrogen assimilation to maintain symbiont population density, photosynthesis, and carbon translocation may allow larvae to avoid bleaching and highlights potential life stage specific metabolic responses to stress.",10.1371/journal.pbio.3002875,Web of Science

In this study, Amphioctopus fangsiao, a common octopus in China, was exposed to DBDPE (0, 1, 50, 100, 300mug/L) for 28days. Chemical analysis revealed that the digestive gland bore a greater burden of DBDPE compared with other tissues. In addition, accumulated DBDPE could curb the growth and feeding performance of A. fangsiao. The potential effects on the gut-digestive gland axis were also elucidated. Specifically, DBDPE in the gut shifted the microorganisms toward a Bacteroidetes-dominated composition, and impaired the intestinal epithelial barrier, thereby triggering oxidative stress and inflammation. Excessive DBDPE also threatens the digestive gland function, including histological damage, immune reaction, oxidative stress, glucolipid metabolism dysfunction, and neurotoxicity. Metabolome plasticity enabled A. fangsiao to develop a DBDPE stress-adaptive metabolic profile via alteration of glucolipid metabolism, immunity, oxidative stress, and signaling molecules. Taken together, we identified a new detoxification mechanism linking the microbiota-gut-digestive gland axis with the growth and food intake of A. fangsiao, which is the first time it has been demonstrated in mollusks.

The results indicated that cold stress disrupted nucleotide metabolism and inhibited gluconeogenesis.

In the Porsangerfjord (Northern Norway), the average water temperature ranges from 2.5 degrees C in March to 10 degrees C in August. MHWs frequently exceed the summer maximum by up to 6 degrees C with so far unknown ecological effects. The green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, is a key grazer on habitat-forming kelp in Subarctic fjord systems. At high abundances, sea urchins transform productive kelp beds through pronounced grazing into depleted sea urchin barrens. In a laboratory experiment, we investigated the influence of acute temperature change on the grazing activity and the metabolic performance of the green sea urchin. Grazing rates increased continuously from 2 to 10 degrees C but decreased again at 14 degrees C. At 22 degrees C, rapid decay of sea urchins were associated with changes of the metabolic energy state from aerobiosis to anaerobiosis. We propose two scenarios: Moderate warming might lead to the proliferation of the sea urchin population and increased grazing pressure on kelp forests, while extreme warming, as predicted by the end of the century, as well as the occurrence of extreme MHWs, may severely impair the sea urchin population and, in turn, might favour the proliferation of adaptable kelp species.",10.1093/icesjms/fsae181,Web of Science

We investigated the responses of M. edulis and M. trossulus to salinity variations by examining shell closure thresholds and tissue levels of 35 metabolic intermediates in mussels acclimated to different salinities (25, 16, and 10). The salinity threshold for valve closure was similar in both studied species, but M. trossulus consistently opened at lower salinities (by 0.2-0.7 practical salinity units) compared to M. edulis. Salinity-induced changes in metabolite levels were similar between the two species. Taurine emerged as the dominant osmolyte, comprising over 50% of the total free amino acid pool, with aspartate and glycine contributing 15-30%. Concentrations of taurine, glycine, and total free amino acids declined with decreasing salinity. Taurine to glycine ratios were higher in M. edulis and increased in both species with declining salinity. Acclimation salinity significantly influenced urea cycle intermediates and methionine sulfoxide content, a cellular biomarker of amino acid oxidation. Species-specific differences were observed in purine metabolism, with higher levels of GMP and AMP found in M. edulis.

Owing to climate change, sea warming constituting a severe source of environmental stress for marine organisms, since it increases at alarming rates. Rapid warming can exceed resilience of marine organisms leading to fitness loss and mortality.

Moreover, proteolysis was inhibited and protein turnover regulated by the heat hardening. Heat stress alters the metabolic profile of heat stressed mussels, benefiting the heat-hardened individuals in increasing their heat tolerance compared to the non-heat-hardened ones.Discussion: These findings provide new insights in the metabolic mechanisms that may reinforce mussels' tolerance against thermal stress providing both natural protection and potential manipulative tools (e.g., in aquaculture) against the devastating climate change effects on marine organisms.",10.3389/fphys.2023.1244314,Web of Science

Experimental evolution of the coral's microalgal symbionts followed by their introduction into coral is one potential method to enhance coral thermotolerance. Heat-evolved microalgal symbionts of the generalist species, Cladocopium proliferum (strain SS8), were exposed to elevated temperature (31°C) for ~10 years, and were introduced into four genotypes of chemically bleached adult fragments of the scleractinian coral, Galaxea fascicularis. Two of the four coral genotypes acquired SS8. The new symbionts persisted for the 5 months of the experiment and enhanced adult coral thermotolerance, compared with corals that were inoculated with the wild-type C. proliferum strain. Thermotolerance of SS8-corals was similar to that of coral fragments from the same colony hosting the homologous symbiont, Durusdinium sp., which is naturally heat tolerant. However, SS8-coral fragments exhibited faster growth and recovered cell density and photochemical efficiency more quickly following chemical bleaching and inoculation under ambient temperature relative to Durusdinium-corals. Mass spectrometry imaging suggests that algal pigments involved in photobiology and oxidative stress were the greatest contributors to the thermotolerance differences between coral hosting heat-evolved versus wild-type C. proliferum. These pigments may have increased photoprotection in the heat-evolved symbionts. This is the first laboratory study to show that thermotolerance of adult corals (G. fascicularis) can be enhanced via the uptake of exogenously supplied, heat-evolved symbionts, without a trade-off against growth under ambient temperature. Importantly, heat-evolved C. proliferum remained in the corals in moderate abundance 2 years after first inoculation, suggesting long-term stability of this novel symbiosis and potential long-term benefits to coral thermotolerance.",10.1111/gcb.16987,ProQuest

Transcriptome analysis detected 1108 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the control group and the hypoxia group. The gene ontology (GO) analysis of DEGs revealed that they are significantly enriched in functions such as “microtubule−based process”, “histone (H3–K4, H3–K27, and H4–K20) trimethylation”, “histone H4 acetylation”, “kinesin complex”, and “ATPase activity”, and KEGG pathway functions, such as “DNA replication”, “Apoptosis”, and “MAPK signaling pathways”. Metabolome analysis identified 68 significantly different metabolites from all identified metabolites, and associated with 25 metabolic pathways between the control and hypoxia groups. These pathways included aminoacyl−tRNA biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, and phenylalanine metabolism. Our integrated analysis suggested that pearl oysters were subject to oxidative stress, apoptosis, immune inhibition, and neuronal excitability reduction under long-term hypoxic conditions.

Some functional and ecological traits promoting tolerance to acidification in these organisms have been identified, while the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying acclimatisation or genetic adaptation are still largely unknown.

Under ambient temperatures, P. acuta predominantly associated with endosymbionts of the genera Cladocopium (reef) or Durusdinium (mangrove), exhibiting elevated metabolism in mangrove through energy-generating and biosynthesis pathways compared to reef populations. Under transient heat stress, P. acuta endosymbiont associations were unchanged. Reef corals bleached and exhibited extensive shifts in symbiont metabolic profiles (whereas host metabolite profiles were unchanged). By contrast, mangrove populations did not bleach and solely the host metabolite profiles were altered, including cellular responses in inter-partner signalling, antioxidant capacity and energy storage.

Yet, connecting physiological processes to metabolites detected remains a challenge due to the lack of structural and activity annotations and the underlying complexity of mixed samples (e.g., multiple microorganisms, organelles, etc.). To simplify this biological complexity, we separated coral holobionts into host mitochondria and their algal symbionts prior to LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomic analysis followed by molecular networking. We found distinct metabolomic profiles between tissue fractions. Notably, 14% of metabolites detected were only observed in the mitochondria and algal symbionts, not in the holobiont, and thus were masked when the bulk (holobiont) sample was analyzed. The utility of tissue separation for hypothesis testing was assessed using a simple temperature experiment. We tested the hypothesis that membrane lipids of the coral mitochondria and algal symbionts become more saturated at higher temperatures to maintain membrane rigidity. While the holobiont metabolite profiles showed little change in response to elevated temperature, there was a change in lipid saturation of both fractions through time. The fatty acid saturation of both the coral mitochondria and the algal symbionts shifted upon exposure to higher temperatures (1 h) then returned to ambient saturation levels by 4 h, indicating rapid acclimatization to warmer water. Surprisingly, the fractions deviated in opposite directions: during the first hour of the experiment, the mitochondria showed an increase in saturated lipid concentrations, while the algal symbionts showed an increase in unsaturated lipids. Partitioning the holobiont prior to untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed disparate responses to environmental stress that would have gone undetected if only the holobiont/bulk tissue was analyzed.

However, after 10 days in freshwater, they stopped reproducing presumably due to the lack of vital ions in the medium. Therefore, before continuing the freshwater cultures, we tested the survival of a batch of salinity 1 pre-acclimated adults and copepodites in various types of freshwater: deionized, bottled 'mineral' and tap water for 48 h.

Ocean temperatures have been consistently increasing due to climate change, and the frequency of heatwave events on shellfish quality is a growing concern worldwide. Typically, shellfish growing areas are in remote or difficult to access locations which makes in-field sampling and sample preservation of shellfish heat stress difficult. As such, there is a need to investigate in-field sampling approaches that facilitate the study of heat stress in shellfish.

Objectives
This study aims to apply a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) based metabolomics approach to examine molecular mechanisms of heat stress responses in shellfish using abalone as a model, and compare the effects of different quenching protocols on abalone metabolic profiles.

Twenty adult Haliotis iris abalone were exposed to two temperatures (14 °C and 24 °C) for 24 h. Then, haemolymph and muscle tissues of each animal were sampled and quenched with 4 different protocols (liquid nitrogen, dry ice, cold methanol solution and normal ice) which were analyzed via GC–MS for central carbon metabolites.

Results
The effects of different quenching protocols were only observed in muscle tissues in which the cold methanol solution and normal ice caused some changes in the observed metabolic profiles, compared to dry ice and liquid nitrogen. Abalone muscle tissues were less affected by thermal stress than haemolymph. There were 10 and 46 compounds significantly influenced by thermal stress in muscle and haemolymph, respectively. The changes of these metabolite signatures indicate oxidative damage, disturbance of amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, and a shift from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic pathways.

Conclusions
The study provided insights into the heat response of abalone, which could be useful for understanding the effects of marine heatwaves and summer mortality events on abalone. Dry ice appeared to be a suitable protocol, and safer in-field alternative to liquid nitrogen, for quenching of abalone tissues.",10.1007/s11306-021-01862-8,Manual

This response is called 'heat hardening' as it leads to the generation of phenotypes with increased heat tolerance. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of heat hardening on the metabolomic profile of Mytilus galloprovincialis in order to identify the associated adjustments of biochemical pathways that might benefit the mussels' thermal tolerance. Thus, mussels were exposed sequentially to two different phases (heat hardening and acclimation phases). To gain further insight into the possible mechanisms underlying the metabolic response of the heat-hardened M. galloprovincialis, metabolomics analysis was complemented by the estimation of mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), pyruvate kinase (PK) and alternative oxidase (AOX) implicated in the metabolic pathways of gluconeogenesis, glycolysis and redox homeostasis, respectively. Heat-hardened mussels showed evidence of higher activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and diversification of upregulated metabolic pathways, possibly as a mechanism to increase ATP production and extend survival under heat stress. Moreover, formate and taurine accumulation provide an antioxidant and cytoprotective role in mussels during hypoxia and thermal stress. Overall, the metabolic responses in non-heat-hardened and heat-hardened mussels underline the upper thermal limits of M. galloprovincialis, set at 26 degrees C, and are in accordance with the OCLTT concept. The ability of heat-hardened mussels to undergo a rapid gain and slow loss of heat tolerance may be an advantageous strategy for coping with intermittent and often extreme temperatures.",10.1242/jeb.244795,Both

Here we develop a framework to analyze the broad macro-physiological and molecular responses over a wide pH range in juvenile oyster. We identify low tipping points for physiological traits at pH 7.3–6.9 that coincide with a major reshuffling in membrane lipids and transcriptome. In contrast, a drop in pH affects shell parameters above tipping points, likely impacting animal fitness. These findings were made possible by the development of an innovative methodology to synthesize and identify the main patterns of variations in large -omic data sets, fitting them to pH and identifying molecular tipping points.

Nitrogen availability controls the growth and density of Symbiodiniaceae within coral tissues and has been proposed to play a role in host derived symbiosis regulation. Warming ocean temperatures and subsequent increases in dissolved organic carbon can potentially increase nitrogen fixation and lead to bleaching. We investigated the importance of nitrogen metabolism in vivo with LC-MS based stable isotope tracing using nubbins from three species of Hawaiian coral, the more heat tolerant Montipora capitata and Porites compressa and the more heat sensitive Pocillopora acuta, that were collected from reefs in Kāne’ohe Bay, O’ahu. In addition to 15N incorporation into nucleotides, amino acids, and urea cycle metabolites, we also observed significant isotopic labeling in dipeptides, supporting their previous identification as major heat stress response metabolites. Surprisingly, the dipeptides are highly enriched in 15N compared to free amino acids, which are the biosynthetic precursors for dipeptides. This suggests that there is a high turnover of dipeptide pools and distinct biosynthetic mechanisms that separately mediate amino acid and dipeptide production. These preliminary data show that nitrogen assimilation in the coral holobiont is likely compartmentalized, with rapid assimilation and quick dipeptide turnover occurring in one region of the holobiont and slow turnover of other nitrogen containing metabolites in other region(s).",10.3389/fmars.2022.1035523,Web of Science

Corals, which form the foundation of biodiverse reef ecosystems, are under threat from warming oceans. Reefs provide essential ecological services, including food, income from tourism, nutrient cycling, waste removal, and the absorption of wave energy to mitigate erosion. Here, we studied the coral thermal stress response using network methods to analyze transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data generated from the Hawaiian rice coral Montipora capitata. Coral nubbins were exposed to ambient or thermal stress conditions over a 5-week period, coinciding with a mass spawning event of this species. The major goal of our study was to expand the inventory of thermal stress-related genes and metabolites present in M. capitata and to study gene-metabolite interactions. These interactions provide the foundation for functional or genetic analysis of key coral genes as well as provide potentially diagnostic markers of pre-bleaching stress. A secondary goal of our study was to analyze the accumulation of sex hormones prior to and during mass spawning to understand how thermal stress may impact reproductive success in M. capitata.

Methods
M. capitata was exposed to thermal stress during its spawning cycle over the course of 5 weeks, during which time transcriptomic and polar metabolomic data were collected. We analyzed these data streams individually, and then integrated both data sets using MAGI (Metabolite Annotation and Gene Integration) to investigate molecular transitions and biochemical reactions.

Results
Our results reveal the complexity of the thermal stress phenome in M. capitata, which includes many genes involved in redox regulation, biomineralization, and reproduction. The size and number of modules in the gene co-expression networks expanded from the initial stress response to the onset of bleaching. The later stages involved the suppression of metabolite transport by the coral host, including a variety of sodium-coupled transporters and a putative ammonium transporter, possibly as a response to reduction in algal productivity. The gene-metabolite integration data suggest that thermal treatment results in the activation of animal redox stress pathways involved in quenching molecular oxygen to prevent an overabundance of reactive oxygen species. Lastly, evidence that thermal stress affects reproductive activity was provided by the downregulation of CYP-like genes and the irregular production of sex hormones during the mass spawning cycle. Overall, redox regulation and metabolite transport are key components of the coral animal thermal stress phenome. Mass spawning was highly attenuated under thermal stress, suggesting that global climate change may negatively impact reproductive behavior in this species.",10.7717/peerj.12335,Manual

We selected, as an ideal study species, the American lobster Homarus americanus, and investigated life history traits, whole-organism physiology, and metabolomic fingerprints from larval stage I to juvenile stage V exposed to different pCO2 levels. Current and future ocean acidification scenarios were tested, as well as extreme high pCO2/low pH conditions that are predicted to occur in coastal benthic habitats and with leakages from underwater carbon capture storage (CCS) sites. Larvae demonstrated greater tolerance to elevated pCO2, showing no significant changes in survival, developmental time, morphology, and mineralisation, although they underwent intense metabolomic reprogramming. Conversely, juveniles showed the inverse pattern, with a reduction in survival and an increase in development time at the highest pCO2 levels tested, with no indication of metabolomic reprogramming. Metabolomic sensitivity to elevated pCO2 increased until metamorphosis (between larval and juvenile stages) and decreased afterward, suggesting this transition as a metabolic keystone for marine invertebrates with complex life cycles.",10.3390/metabo11090584,Manual

Gametes of S. intermedius were fertilized and developed to the four-armed larval stage in either current natural seawater pH levels (as Control; pH = 7.99 ± 0.01) or laboratory-controlled acidified conditions (OA1: ΔpH = −0.3 units; OA2: ΔpH = −0.4 units; OA3: ΔpH = −0.5 units) according to the predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The degrees of spicule exposure and asymmetry and mortality of four-armed larvae of S. intermedius were observed; each had a significant linearly increasing trend as the seawater pH level decreased. Comparative metabolome analysis identified a total of 87 significantly differentially expressed metabolites (SDMs, UP: 57, DOWN: 30) in OA-treated groups compared with the control group. Twenty-three SDMs, including carnitine, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 18:3, lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine (LPE) 16:1, glutathione (GSH) and L-ascorbate, exhibited a linear increasing trend with decreasing seawater pH. Nine SDMs exhibited a linear decreasing trend as the seawater pH declined, including hypoxanthine, guanine and thymidine. Among all SDMs, we further mined 48 potential metabolite biomarkers responding to seawater acidification in four-armed larvae of S. intermedius. These potential metabolite biomarkers were mainly enriched in five pathways: glycerophospholipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle).

In recent years, larval shell formation of marine bivalves has been severely affected by ocean acidification (OA), and previous study indicated that OA might affect such process by disrupting endogenous energy metabolism. Developmental stages from trochophore to D-shape larvae are extremely important for initial shell formation in oyster since a calcified shell was formed to cover the chitin one. In the present study, metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches were employed to investigate the energy metabolism of oyster larvae during initial shell (prodissoconch I, PDI shell) formation and under experimental OA treatment. Totally 230 chemical compounds were identified from the present dataset, most of which were highly expressed in the “middle” stage (early D-shape larvae) which was critical for PDI shell formation since a calcified shell was formed to cover the chitin one. Several compounds such as glucose, glutarylcarnitine (C5), β-hydroxyisovaleroylcarnitine, 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA), myristoleate (14:1n5) and palmitoleate (16:1n7) were identified, which were involved in energy metabolic processes including amino acid oxidation, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and fatty acid metabolism. In addition, mRNA expressions of genes related to protein metabolism, glycolysis, lipid degradation, calcium transport and organic matrix formation activities were significantly down-regulated upon experimental OA. These results collectively suggested that formation of the initial shell in oyster larvae required endogenous energy coming from amino acid oxidation, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and fatty acid metabolism. These metabolic activities could be severely inhibited by experimental OA, which might alter the allocation of endogenous energy. Insufficient endogenous energy supply then suppressed the mobilization of calcium and resulted in a failure or delay in PDI shell formation.",10.1038/s41598-020-62963-3,Manual

Then, a GC-TOF/MS-based metabolomics analysis was performed to reveal the regulatory roles of fatty acids in shrimp growth, survival and osmoregulation at two salinities. The shrimp fed the mixed oil diet had higher weight gain and survival, and those fed the diet with only fish oil added exhibited higher unsaturated fatty acid levels in the gills and hepatopancreas irrespective of salinity. Na+/K+-ATPase and total ATPase activities were lowest in the shrimp fed the mixed oil diet at both salinities.

The comparative transcriptome analysis between ammonia-treated and control (LV-C) groups revealed involvement of immune defense, cytoskeleton remodeling, antioxidative system and metabolic pathway in ammonia-stress response of L. vannamei. Likewise, metabolomics analysis showed that ammonia exposure could disturb amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism and lipid metabolism, with metabolism related-genes changed according to RNA-seq analysis. The comparison of metabolite and transcript profiles between LV-AT and LV-AS indicated that LV-AT used the enhanced glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle strategies for energy supply and ammonia excretion to adapt high-concentration ammonia. Furthermore, some of genes involved in the detoxification and ammonia excretion were highly expressed in LV-AT. We speculate that the higher ability of ammonia excretion and detoxification and the accelerated energy metabolism for energy supplies might be the adaptive strategies for LV-AT relative to LV-AS after ammonia stress. Collectively, the combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics results will greatly contribute to incrementally understand the stress responses on ammonia exposure to L. vannamei and supply molecular level support for evaluating the environmental effects of ammonia on aquatic organisms.

We documented the phospholipid remodeling as well as quick modulation in inflammatory responses and extensive vesicle formation for subcellular compartmentalization and autophagosome formation, as well as the possible impacts on mitochondrial bioenergetics in the Cu-exposed oysters. The lipidomics approach provided a comprehensive lipid profile of possible alteration by Cu exposure. In combination with other omics approaches, it may be possible to elucidate the pathways and mechanisms in stress acclimation and resilience associated between Cu contamination and lipid metabolism.",10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.09.011,Web of Science

As a changing climate threatens the persistence of terrestrial and marine ecosystems by altering community composition and function, differential performance of taxa highlights the need for predictive metrics and mechanistic understanding of the factors underlying positive performance in the face of environmental disturbances. Biochemical reactions within cells provide a snapshot of molecular regulation and flexibility during exposure to environmental stressors. However, because the organism is the unit of selection there is a need for the integration of metabolite data with organism physiology to understand mechanisms responsible for individual success under a changing climate.

Objectives
Our study aims to characterize the molecular response of reef corals to simulated global climate change stressors. Furthermore, we seek to relate changes in the molecular physiology to observations in overall colony response.

Methods
To this end, we applied a non-targeted metabolomic approach to describe lipid and primary metabolite composition after exposure of the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis to ambient and elevated experimental climate change conditions. We compared these metabolite data to organism physiology, specifically the key processes of photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification.

Results
Corals significantly altered their lipid and primary metabolite profiles in response to experimental treatments. Primary metabolite profiles predicted organisms’ net photosynthesis, but not calcification or respiration measures. Despite challenges in metabolome annotation, our data indicated corals alter carbohydrate composition, cell structural lipids, and signaling compounds in response to elevated treatment conditions.

As a changing climate threatens the persistence of terrestrial and marine ecosystems by altering community composition and function, differential performance of taxa highlights the need for predictive metrics and mechanistic understanding of the factors underlying positive performance in the face of environmental disturbances. Biochemical reactions within cells provide a snapshot of molecular regulation and flexibility during exposure to environmental stressors. However, because the organism is the unit of selection there is a need for the integration of metabolite data with organism physiology to understand mechanisms responsible for individual success under a changing climate.

Objectives
Our study aims to characterize the molecular response of reef corals to simulated global climate change stressors. Furthermore, we seek to relate changes in the molecular physiology to observations in overall colony response.

Methods
To this end, we applied a non-targeted metabolomic approach to describe lipid and primary metabolite composition after exposure of the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis to ambient and elevated experimental climate change conditions. We compared these metabolite data to organism physiology, specifically the key processes of photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification.

Results
Corals significantly altered their lipid and primary metabolite profiles in response to experimental treatments. Primary metabolite profiles predicted organisms’ net photosynthesis, but not calcification or respiration measures. Despite challenges in metabolome annotation, our data indicated corals alter carbohydrate composition, cell structural lipids, and signaling compounds in response to elevated treatment conditions.

Epigenetic mechanisms may be crucial for sessile benthic marine organisms, such as reef-building corals, where ocean acidification (OA) and warming reflect in strong negative responses. We tested the potential for scleractinian corals to exhibit phenotypic plasticity associated with a change in DNA methylation in response to OA. Clonal coral fragments of the environmentally sensitive Pocillopora damicornis and more environmentally robust Montipora capitata were exposed to fluctuating ambient pH (7.9-7.65) and low pH (7.6-7.35) conditions in common garden tanks for similar to 6 weeks. M. capitata responded weakly, or acclimated more quickly, to OA, with no difference in calcification, minimal separation of metabolomic profiles, and no change in DNA methylation between treatments. Conversely, P. damicornis exhibited diminished calcification at low pH, stronger separation in metabolomic profiles, and responsiveness of DNA methylation to treatment. Our data suggest corals differ in their temporal dynamics and sensitivity for environmentally triggered real-time epigenetic reprogramming. The generation of potentially heritable plasticity via environmental induction of DNA methylation provides an avenue for assisted evolution applications in corals under rapid climate change.",10.1111/eva.12408,Both

The survival and distribution of species partly depend on their ability to exploit their physiological plasticity during acclimatization. Therefore, in laboratory studies the effects of simulated future ocean acidification on thermal tolerance, energy metabolism and acid–base regulation capacity of the North Sea population of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis were examined. Following one month of pre-acclimation to 10°C and control CO2 levels, mussels were exposed for two weeks to control and projected oceanic CO2 levels (390, 750 and 1120μatm) before being subjected to a stepwise warming protocol between 10°C and 31°C (+3°C each night). Oxygen consumption and heart rates, anaerobic metabolite levels and haemolymph acid–base status were determined at each temperature. CO2 exposure left oxygen consumption rate unchanged at acclimation temperature but caused a somewhat stronger increase during acute warming and thus mildly higher Q10-values than seen in controls. Interestingly, the thermally induced limitation of oxygen consumption rate set in earlier in normocapnic than in hypercapnic (1120μatm CO2) mussels (25.2°C vs. 28.8°C), likely due to an onset of metabolic depression in the control group following warming. However, the temperature induced increase in heart rate became limited above 25°C in both groups indicating an unchanged pejus temperature regardless of CO2 treatment. An upper critical temperature was reached above 28°C in both treatments indicated by the accumulation of anaerobic metabolites in the mantle tissue, paralleled by a strong increase in haemolymph PCO2 at 31°C. Ocean acidification caused a decrease in haemolymph pH. The extracellular acidosis remained largely uncompensated despite some bicarbonate accumulation. In all treatments animals developed a progressive warming-induced extracellular acidosis. A stronger pH drop at around 25°C was followed by stagnating heart rates. However, normocapnic mussels enhanced bicarbonate accumulation at the critical limit, a strategy no longer available to hypercapnic mussels. In conclusion, CO2 has small effects on the response patterns of mussels to warming, leaving thermal thresholds largely unaffected. High resilience of adult North Sea mussels to future ocean acidification indicates that sensitivity to thermal stress is more relevant in shaping the response to future climate change.",10.1016/j.jembe.2015.08.001,ProQuest

In addition, possible leakage from sub-seabed storage of anthropogenic CO2 may pose a threat to the marine environment. 1H NMR spectroscopy was applied to extracts of hemolymph, gills and leg muscle from shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) to examine the metabolic response to elevated levels of CO2. Crabs were exposed to different levels of CO2‐acidified seawater with pHNBS 7.4, 6.6 and 6.3 (pCO2 ~ 2600, 16,000 and 30,000 μatm, respectively) for two weeks (level-dependent exposure). In addition, the metabolic response was followed for up to 4 weeks of exposure to seawater pHNBS 6.9 (pCO2 ~ 7600 μatm). Partial least squares regression analysis of data showed an increased differentiation between metabolic fingerprints of controls and exposed groups for all sample types with increasing CO2 levels. Difference between controls and animals subjected to time-dependent exposure appeared after 4 weeks in the hemolymph and gills, and after 48 h of exposure in the leg muscle. Changes in metabolic profiles were mainly due to a reduced level of important intracellular osmolytes such as amino acids (glycine, proline), while the level of other metabolites varied between the different sample types. The results are similar to what is observed in animals exposed to hypo-osmotic stress and may suggest disturbances in intracellular iso-osmotic regulation. The results may also reflect increased catabolism of amino acids to supply the body fluids with proton-buffering ammonia (NH3). Alternatively, the findings may reflect an exhaustive effect of CO2 exposure.",10.1016/j.cbd.2012.06.001,Manual

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of an acute temperature rise on energy metabolism of the oyster, Crassostrea gigas chronically exposed to elevated CO2 levels (partial pressure of CO2 in the seawater similar to 0.15 kPa, seawater pH similar to 7.7). Within one month of incubation at elevated PCO2 and 15 degrees C hemolymph pH fell (pH(e) = 7.1 +/- 0.2 (CO2-group) vs. 7.6 +/- 0.1 (control)) and PeCO2 values in hemolymph increased (0.5 +/- 0.2 kPa (CO2-group) vs. 0.2 +/- 0.04 kPa (control)).

Upon acute warming SMR rose in both groups, but displayed a stronger increase in the CO2-incubated group. Investigation in isolated gill cells revealed a similar temperature-dependence of respiration between groups. Furthermore, the fraction of cellular energy demand for ion regulation via Na+/K+-ATPase was not affected by chronic hypercapnia or temperature. Metabolic profiling using H-1-NMR spectroscopy revealed substantial changes in some tissues following OA exposure at 15 degrees C. In mantle tissue alanine and ATP levels decreased significantly whereas an increase in succinate levels was observed in gill tissue.

In this study, a system biology tool, metabolomics, was applied to the marine mussel Perna viridis to investigate changes in the metabolic profiles of soft tissue as a response to copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd), both as single metal and as a mixture. The major metabolite changes corresponding to metal exposure are related to amino acids, osmolytes, and energy metabolites. Following metal exposure for 1 week, there was a significant increase in the levels of branched chain amino acids, histidine, glutamate, glutamine, hypotaurine, dimethylglycine, arginine and ATP/ADP. For the Cu + Cd co-exposed mussels, the levels of lactate, branched chain amino acid, succinate, and NAD increased, whereas the levels of glucose, glycogen, and ATP/ADP decreased, indicating a different metabolic profile for the single metal exposure groups. After 2 weeks of exposure, the mussels showed acclimatization to Cd exposure based on the recovery of some metabolites. However, the metabolic profile induced by the metal mixture was very similar to that from Cu exposure, suggesting that Cu dominantly induced the metabolic disturbances. Both Cu and Cd may lead to neurotoxicity, disturbances in energy metabolism, and osmoregulation changes. These results demonstrate the high applicability and reliability of NMR-based metabolomics in interpreting the toxicological mechanisms of metals using global metabolic biomarkers.

Crabs were acclimated for 7 days to a salinity of 5 or 35parts per thousand and then placed in a flow apparatus that could sustain the animals while NMR spectra were acquired. Crabs were subjected to either hyperosmotic salinity changes, where an animal acclimated to 5parts per thousand was exposed to a salinity of 35parts per thousand, or hyposmotic changes, which involved the reciprocal exchange. Neither acclimation salinity nor salinity change had a significant effect on the concentrations of arginine phosphate, inorganic phosphate or ATP. P-31-NMR saturation transfer experiments were used to determine the effect of salinity on the forward and reverse flux of the AK reaction. There was no significant effect of acclimation salinity or salinity change on the flux rate through this reaction. This is in contrast to previous results, which showed that AK flux in isolated muscle was sensitive to prevailing osmotic conditions (Holt and Kinsey, J. Exp. Biol. 205 (2002) 17751785).

Isolated dark Ievator muscles from the swimming leg were superfused with a saline solution that had an osmolarity equivalent to that of the hemolymph under different salinity regimes. Animals were acclimated for 7 days to a salinity of 5, 17 or 35parts per thousand, which corresponds to a hemolymph osmolarity of 640, 720 or 960 mosmol l(-1), respectively. Experiments were conducted under control conditions, in which the osmolarity of the superfusion medium matched that of the acclimated hemolymph, as well as under hypo- and hyperosmotic conditions. These latter treatments were meant to simulate a rapid change in environmental salinity. Pseudo-first-order unidirectional rate constants and flux rates were measured for arginine kinase in the forward and reverse directions using a P-31-nuclear magnetic resonance saturation transfer method. There were no differences in the rate constants or flux rates among the controls, indicating that arginine kinase function is not modulated by salinity if the animal has had sufficient acclimation time. However, the rate constants and flux rates of arginine kinase varied over a modest 1.7-fold range across the three types of osmotic treatments, although the range for the flux data was reduced when cell volume changes were taken into account. The hyperosmotic treatments led to a reduction in arginine kinase flux, while the hypo-osmotic treatments led to an enhanced arginine kinase flux. We propose that this effect is mediated by an increase in the concentration of perturbing inorganic ions under hyperosmotic conditions and a decrease in the concentration of such ions during the hypo-osmotic treatments.",10.1242/jeb.205.12.1775,Web of Science
